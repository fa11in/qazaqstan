            <h class="p">Traditional food of Kazakhstan</h>
            <p id="p1">Before starting off about the Kazakh cuisine there are some facts you should be enlightened about. Obviously the cuisine was hugely influenced by the nomadic lifestyle that developed amidst the changing habitats throughout this vast country. From mountainous regions to the great steppes, from arid deserts to rich ecohabitats with forests, rivers and lakes; all this geographical diversity resulted in the creation of the variety of national dishes in different regions of Kazakhstan. </p>
            <p id = "p1">In the more frigid regions, people have been seen to adopt a meat based diet full of protein, fat and nutrients; where as in the more temperate climates people are used to adding a lot of fresh vegetables and cereals to their dishes. In the areas near the Caspian Sea, due to the higher availability of sea food, meat is often substituted by fish and other seafood instead. In the end a lack of restrictions to changes in the recipes and the way it's served makes this cuisine much more interesting. Tasting this cuisine will also allow you to get a better sense of Kazakh national culture and its diversity.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 5px;">Baursak is a delicious puffy fried bread served on special occasions all over Kazakhstan. This isn’t an everyday bread, but something for an important party, like a wedding, or even a memorial. It is said that the smell of the oil and the frying baursak floats high into the sky so that your dead loved ones can feed on the aroma and enjoy them with you. It’s a beautiful thought as you fry.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 5px;">Kazy is a Kazakh horse sausage that is also prepared in other Central Asian countries such as Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. Traditionally, the sausage is made with meat and fat taken from the ribs. It is usually seasoned with garlic, pepper, and salt before being stuffed into natural casings.

                            The sausage can be sold raw or lightly smoked, and before consumption, it is usually boiled and served sliced. Although it is mostly enjoyed as an appetizer, kazy can also be incorporated into various dishes.</p>
