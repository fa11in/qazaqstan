      <h class="p"> History of Kazakhstan </h>
      <p id="p1">Kazakhstan is believed to have been inhabited as early as the Stone Age, a prehistoric period characterized by the use of stone tools. It was only in the beginning of the 15th century when Kazakh identity came into being and was consolidated into the culture and language of the Kazakhs in the 16th century.<br> After becoming stronger as a people, the Kazakhs fought off a federation of armed Western Mongol tribes in the 17th century, and went on to win major victories invading forces in the following century.</p>
      <p id = "p1">During the 19th century, however, the vast Russian empire started to expand in Central Asia, ruling most of the countries in the region, including most parts of Kazakhstan which the Russians finally colonized. Following the colonization, some 400,000 Russians immigrated to the country and were followed by one million Slavs, Germans and Jews to establish their residency in the country. This resulted in direct competition between the Kazakhs and the newcomers and in a series of clashes between the natives and the Russians.<br>
