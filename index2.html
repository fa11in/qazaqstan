      <h class="p">  About Kazakhstan </h>
      <p id="p1">The Republic of Kazakhstan is situated at the heart of Eurasia and is the worlds 9th largest country. When Kazakhstan became independent in the unstable days of December 1991,few people thought the country would achieve as much as it did in its first 20 years.Instead of disintegrating, Kazakhstanâ€™s economy became one of the fastest growing in the world, and the country has built a robust political system of presidential and parliamentary democracy with its media and NGOs enjoying a growing voice and role in shaping the society.</p>
      <p id = "p1">The name "Kazakh" comes from the ancient Turkic word qaz, "to wander", reflecting the Kazakhs' nomadic culture. The term "Cossack" is of the same origin. The Persian suffix -stan means "land" or "place of", so Kazakhstan can be literally translated as "land of the wanderers".
          Though the term traditionally referred to only ethnic Kazakhs, including those living in China, Russia, Turkey, Uzbekistan and other neighbouring countries, the term Kazakh is increasingly being used to refer to any inhabitant of Kazakhstan, including non-Kazakhs.</p>
